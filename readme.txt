In this repo, you will find the necessary code and data related to the 'Efficient Real-Time Scene Classification in ROS
Applications and Low-Power Devices' paper. 

Note:
The model's naming is slightly off, with some being named epoch 19 and others being named epoch 20. However, each model was saved after 20 epochs and this discrepancy is caused due to the automatic file naming in Python. I.e., for all-scenes models
the epoch number was saved but for the indoor-scenes models the epoch number + 1 was saved.
